Some thoughts on getting my Bachelor's Degree.

## The Obvious Excitement

Naturally, I was excited to finally get the physical copy of my degree. The paper itself doesn't mean much, but it represents a milestone and comes as a result of 5 years' worth of coursework, projects, studying, and attending lectures. I managed to get an *"Excellent"* grade, which is the highest grade bracket in the University system, even though I landed just on the threshold to do so (85/100).

## The Not-So-Obvious Disappointment

On the other hand, the truth is that I am not happy, nor satisfied, with my academic performance. To begin with, taking an extra year to complete my degree made me feel ashamed. Moreover, I would like to believe that this grade does not represent my actual skills and knowledge.

The main reason for this is that I was working part-time during my studies, which meant that I had to balance work and school. This led to me not being able to dedicate as much time to my studies as I would have liked, and I often found myself rushing through assignments and exams.

The other reason is that as the years went by, there were some mandatory courses that were very focused on specific topics that I was not interested in, while also being very theory-heavy, such as *"Computer Networks"* or *"Principles of Databases."* Nevertheless, I acknowledged their importance and made sure to study them thoroughly, but that didn't mean I liked them any more because of that. 
Another issue regarding course selection is that the Department of Computer Science at my University is very focused on **not** letting students specialize in a specific area of Computer Science during their Bachelor's Degree. This means that I had to choose courses that I wasn't interested in, even though they were not part of the core curriculum that is mandatory to attend.

## The Future

I am looking forward to starting my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the same University. I am hoping that this will give me the opportunity to specialize in areas that I am actually interested in, such as software engineering, programming languages, and low-level programming. I am also looking forward to the opportunity of doing everything right this time, from start to finish, without having to rush through assignments or exams. I am determined to make the most of my Master's Degree and to prove to myself that I can achieve the level of knowledge and skills that I aspire to, as well as the maximum grade possible.
